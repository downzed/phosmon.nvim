# phosmon.nvim
> A simple attempt to port [`photon.vim`](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim) to `phosmon.nvim`

`phosmon.nvim` is a minimal, monotone (as possible) colorscheme designed for Neovim, trying to preserve the aesthetics of the original `photon.vim` theme while using the benefits of Lua.

### Installation
Using lazy.nvim:

```
{
    'downzed/phosmon.nvim',
    opts = {}
}
```

### Integrations
- [ ] light theme
- [x] lualine
- [x] tree-sitter (might be off)
- [x] mini.starter
- [ ] more to come
- [ ] suggestions?


### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance this port.
I probably missed something, and I'm color-blind, so be gentle.
